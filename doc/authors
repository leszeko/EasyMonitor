Easy Monitor is set of SuperKaramba themes. Any of
these themes you can edit and configure after lock
its position on screen and click on top frame.
My idea to give users fast and easy access to edit
and fix code. So you can suit it to your system.
To work all features You have to install some
additional programs and modify sudoers rights.
Go(o)d play time :) ; Read install.txt in ./doc
Click on the bottom frame and select a theme
